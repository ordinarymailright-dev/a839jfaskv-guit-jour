          </a>
          <div class="divider-sm"></div>
          <p>My very first year of playing guitar. I started recording my pieces in may. I've played through many well known teachers like Carcassi, Juliani, and Sagreras, slavic 
          folk songs, and some more niche authors as well. This year was me learning the fundamentals of guitar.

          Second Year
          </a>
          <div class="divider-sm"></div>
          <p>My development year as a guitarist. I started playing more serious pieces, learning music theory, and finding more composers.
            It was the year when classical guitar became my full passion. Many pieces I learned
            will be in my repertoire for years, ranging from famous pieces like Lagrima and Romance, and the pieces I deeply admire like Julia Florida
            and El Dia Florece Contigo.

          <p>Coming soon. My plans are to learn more advanced pieces and build my technique so in the future I
            can play any piece I want.
