              <p>• Learned fundamentals of the guitar, technique, and musicality<br>
                • Found many composers/teachers like Carcassi, Giuliani, Tarrega and others<br>
                • Started getting into the music world as a whole and developing my
                sense of taste/personality<br>
                • Started with simple voice lines and melodies, ended with <i>Chi Mai</i> - a movie
                soundtrack arranged for guitar

              <p>• Solidified my technique and developed a sense of musical style<br>
                • Started to love and appreciate many composers and teachers like Barrios, 
                Sagreras, and Dilermando Reis<br>
                • Played through a more serious repertoire, ending with 
                two pieces by Ivanov-Kramskoy and <i>El Dia Florece Contigo</i><br>
                • As of 2025, it is the latest year of my guitar journey

              <p>The year is still to come, but I already have some plans for it:<br>
                • Strengthen my technique so that I can pick up majority
                of the pieces I stumble upon and play by myself<br>
                • Continue developing my musical style and find even more
                of great composers/arrangers<br>
                • By the end of the year, try to play one of my role model
                pieces (<i>Asturias</i>, <i>La Catedral</i>, <i>Un Sueño En La Floresta</i>)

                and has one of the best schools you can get from my website (free)<br>
                • I grouped his exersices so you can go and practice the skills
                 you need the most<br>
                • He is one of the people every classical guitarist should know
