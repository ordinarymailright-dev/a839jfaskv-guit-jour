              <p>• First lesson was on February 13<br>
                • Learned fundamentals of the guitar, technique, and musicality<br>
                • Found many composers/teachers like Carcassi, Giuliani, Tarrega and others<br>
                • Started getting into the music world as a whole and developing my
                sense of taste/personality<br>
                • Started with simple voice lines and melodies, ended with <i>Chi Mai</i> - a movie
                soundtrack arranged for guitar
              </p>

              <p>• Solidified my technique and developed a sense of musical style<br>
                • Started to love and appreciate many composers and teachers like Barrios, 
                Sagreras, and Dilermando Reis<br>
                • Played through a more serious repertoire, ending with a
                piece by Dilermando Reis - <i>Se Ela Perguntar</i>
              </p>

              <p>The year has just begun, so I have some plans set for it:<br>
                • Strengthen my technique so that I can pick up majority
                of the pieces I stumble upon and play by myself<br>
                • Continue developing my musical style and find even more
                of great composers/arrangers<br>
                • By the end of the year, try to play one of my role model
                pieces (<i>Capriccio Arabe</i>, <i>Un Sueno En La Floresta</i>, <i>Standchen</i>)
              </p>

                try<br>
                • An Argentine man who established his very school at 25
                and has one of the best schools you can get from my website (free)<br>
                • I grouped his exersices so you can go and practice the skills
                 you need the most<br>
                • He is one of the people every classical guitarist should know
