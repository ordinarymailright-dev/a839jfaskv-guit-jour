            <p>• Learned fundamentals of the guitar, technique, and musicality<br>
              • Found many composers/teachers like Carcassi, Giuliani, Tarrega and others<br>
              • Started getting into the music world as a whole and developing my
              sense of taste/personality<br>
              • Started with simple voice lines, ended with <i>Chi Mai</i> - a movie
              soundtrack arranged for guitar

            <p>• Solidified my technique and developed a sense of musical style<br>
              • Started to love and appreciate many coposers and teachers like Barrios, 
              Sagreras, and Dilermando Reis<br>
              • Played through a more serious repetroire, ending with 
              two pieces by Ivanov-Kramskoy and <i>El Dia Florece Contigo</i><br>

            <p>The year is still to come, but I already have some plans for it:<br>
              • Strengthen my technique so that I can pick up majority
              of the pueces I stumble upon and play by myself.<br>
              • Continue developing my musical style and find even more
              of great composers/arrangers.<br>
              • By the end of the year, try to play one of my role model
              pieces (<i>Asturias</i>, <i>La Catedral</i>, <i>Un Sueno En La Floresta</i>)
            </p>

              try<br>
              • An Argentine man who established his very school at 25
              and has one of the best shoolds you can get from my website (free).<br>
              • A grouping of his school to pick up and start practicing skills you NEED.<br>
              • He is one of the people every classical guitarist should know.
