                    <p>Marko Topchii was the first live guitarist I've ever
                        seen. To this day, I believe he is one of THE classical
                        guitarists of our time. That day he gave us heck of a 
                        performance, with immaculate technique and loud,
                        flashy pieces. The one I still remember is <i>Toccata</i>
                        by Rodrigo. Even got an 
                        autograph after the concert (not on sale). Overall he is a great
                        musician, but that day, as the first time I've ever heard guitar
                        live, it was a life-changing experience. If you get a chance,
                        go see him play.<br>

                        I didn't get a chace to see any other performers at the
                        Guitar society that year, but what I did see was the <i>Candlelight</i>
                        concert: Tribute to Hans Zimmer and Tribute to Joe Hisaishi. The
                        atmosphere is really charming, with all the candles and the acoustics, but also
                        the performers. Both concerts were string quartets, 
                        and both were amazing. I love
                        both composers' music, but Hisaishi's tribute was really something else.
                        Insanely touching performances, though I might
                        be biased. If you're ever close to downtown Toronto, definitely
                        check them out. They also have many pop music tributes as well, but not a fan
                        of pop... at all.<br>

                        Gaëlle Solal is a French classical guitarist who kicked
                        off the Guitar Society's 2025-26 solo season. Her performance
                        wasn't <i>just</i> amazing, but truly spectacular.
                        Her program left me in amazement. From the weird/unconventional
                        techniques that she used and to the most interesting contemporary
                        repertoire I've ever heard, it was the best kickstart you 
                        could ever ask for. Her performance showed me what contemporary
                        music can be, and I never regretted seeing her. Definitely 
                        one hell of a guitarist to check out.<br>

                        Leonela Alejandro's performance will stay in my mind
                        forever. Her tone was pure bliss - it felt so warm, so cozy.
                        I fell in love with her double-top guitar; I didn't 
                        know guitars could sound that good. Besides that, her repertoire was also amazing. 
                        From pure jazz-fusion <i>Appassionata</i> to one of my
                        favourite pieces that day, <i>Pregunta</i>, her performance
                        hit every strand of my soul. She is the
                        <b>best</b> and most touching 
                        guitarist I've seen live to date, and will definitely
                        incorporate some of her pieces into my repertoire as well. I couldn't thank her enough for 
                        such a performance. She is a must-go-to-whenever-she's-live
                        guitarist. Her performance was so great I didn't record anything 
                        that evening. Sometimes you really need to "live in the moment,"
                        and that night was no exception.
